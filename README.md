## Predicting poker hand's strength with artificial neural networks in Python

Based off the similarly titled study ["Predicting Poker Hand's Strength With Artificial Neural Networks"](bit.ly/1RecknH) by Gökay Dişken from Adana STU, PokerNet is a Python-based and undergraduate-led near identical study and final Artificial Intelligence project.

## Abstract

In this study, artificial neural networks are used to classify five cards drawn from a standard deck of 52 by suits and ranks of each card. After determining each cards value, system measures strength of the hand according to the poker game. Machine learning library [PyBrain](https://github.com/pybrain/pybrain) is used to design, train and test the network. The data used in this study is taken from UCI data archive page.

## Methods

Gradient descent method, scaled conjugate gradient method and resilient back-propagation methods are selected as training methods. Each method is used several times for different numbers of neurons, different learning rates, different maximum epoch numbers, and different transfer functions of output layer. Purelin and tansig functions are selected for output layer to see the effect of the functions on results.
